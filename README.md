## Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Grzegorz, a Software Developer from Poland

### 👨‍🏭 Background

I started my career in industrial automation, programming machines and robotic production lines for the automotive industry.  
This gave me strong engineering foundations and a lot of hands-on experience with complex systems.

---

### 🐍 Software Development

For the last 3+ years, I have been working mainly with Python, building:
- APIs
- data platforms
- analytical dashboards
- web applications
- automation tools

While Python remains my primary backend technology, I’ve been expanding into full-stack development, working with **Svelte** to build my own applications and gain end-to-end experience.

### 🤖 AI & LLM

I’m very interested in AI and LLM technologies.  
I have completed postgraduate studies in Machine Learning and have hands-on experience integrating multiple LLMs into real applications, including:
- AI agents
- GraphRAG architectures
- MCP-based servers and clients

### 🗄 Databases

Databases have always been a big part of my work, and I’m comfortable designing and working with data-intensive systems.
